# IFIT (IDAA Functions Interactive Tool) 
 
  This tool enable the execution of main "IDAA" functions in z/OS environment 
  without to use  "IBM Data Studio". 

  By choise, it was  decided to allow the functions in batch mode only, 
  providing an "ad hoc" jcl for  every user selection.
 
  Refer to file "Install_istruction.txt" for installation instructions.

 Refer to file "IFIT – IDAA Functions Interactive Tool.pdf" for a
